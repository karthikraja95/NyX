# Fika

*"A collection of tools for Data Scientists and ML Engineers to automate their workflow of performing analysis to deploying models and pipelines."*

Fika is a library/platform that automates your data science and analytical tasks at any stage in the pipeline. Fika is, at its core, a uniform API that helps automate analytical techniques from various libaries such as pandas, sci-kit learn, spacy, etc.

**Fika** in Swedish - *A moment to slow down and appreciate the good things in life*

## Analysis with Fika

```python
import fika as fk
import pandas as pd

x_train = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karthikraja95/fika/master/examples/data/train.csv') # load data into pandas

# Initialize Data object with training data
# By default, if no test data (x_test) is provided, then the data is split with 20% going to the test set
# 
# Specify predictor field as 'Survived'
df = fk.Classification(x_train, target='Survived')

df.x_train # View your training data
df.x_test # View your testing data

df # Glance at your training data

df[df.Age > 25] # Filter the data

df.x_train['new_col'] = [1,2] # This is the exact same as the either of code above
df.x_test['new_col'] = [1,2]

df.data_report(title='Titanic Summary', output_file='titanic_summary.html') # Automate EDA with pandas profiling with an autogenerated report

df.describe() # Display a high level view of your data using an extended version of pandas describe

df.column_info() # Display info about each column in your data

df.describe_column('Fare') # Get indepth statistics about the 'Fare' column

df.mean() # Run pandas functions on the aethos objects

df.missing_values # View your missing data at anytime

df.correlation_matrix() # Generate a correlation matrix for your training data

df.predictive_power() # Calculates the predictive power of each variable

df.autoviz() # Runs autoviz on the data and runs EDA on your data

df.pairplot() # Generate pairplots for your training data features at any time

df.checklist() # Will provide an iteractive checklist to keep track of your cleaning tasks
```
